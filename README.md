### Satellite Image Classification Using CNN  

## 🌍 Project Overview  
This deep learning project classifies satellite images into four categories: **Water, Green Area, Desert, and Cloud**.  
The model is built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for accurate image recognition.  

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Water**: Satellite images of water bodies  
- **Green Area**: Forests, fields, and vegetated land  
- **Desert**: Arid and sandy landscapes  
- **Cloud**: Various cloud formations  

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used  
- **Python, Pandas, NumPy**  
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib** for visualization  
- **TensorFlow, Keras** for deep learning  
- **Scikit-learn** for evaluation metrics  

## 🔄 Preprocessing Steps  
**Loaded and labeled images:**  
- `0`: Water  
- `1`: Green Area  
- `2`: Desert  
- `3`: Cloud  

**Other Steps:**  
- Shuffled dataset for better generalization  
- Resized images to **64×64 pixels**  
- Split dataset into **training (70%)** and **testing (30%)**
